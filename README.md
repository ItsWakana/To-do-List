# To-do-List

This project took me quite a lot of time to be honest. I feel I've learned a lot about object manipulation and persistence using local storage.

Having the ability to access object values and properties and use that information on the DOM to display what we want to see. These foundational skills of creating,editing and deleting definitely feel a lot more comfortable than they did before.

Also trying my upmost to keep my functionality seperated inside individual modules and having DOM stuff completely seperate from my other modules like arrays of objects and pushing my objects inside arrays.
